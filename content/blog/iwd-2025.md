## Our first meetup of 2025 was a success!

We had a great turnout at our first meetup of 2025, celebrating International Women's Day.

This was the first in-person meetup we've had in a long time. We're really excited to kick-start our
meetups again and to rebuild the Vancouver PyLadies community.
